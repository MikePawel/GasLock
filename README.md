## Description

GasLock is a decentralized application deployed on the NEO X Blockchain. It allows users to lock and vest GAS tokens with smart contract security and transparency. The key functionalities include:

### 1\. **GAS Locking**

- Users can deposit any amount of GAS into the smart contract and lock it for a predefined period.
- The locked funds cannot be redeemed earlier or manipulated by anyone, ensuring absolute security.
- Designed for users who wish to enforce "forced diamond hands," e.g., locking GAS for a year to achieve tax-free status in countries like Germany.

### 2\. **Vesting Schedule Creation**

- Users can create a vesting schedule to distribute a specified amount of GAS tokens to a recipient over time.
- Vesting options include hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly intervals, ending at the specified deadline.
- Ideal for scenarios such as payroll management, contract-based payments, or structured disbursement of funds.

## Key Features

- **Immutable and Transparent:** The smart contract is verified and deployed on the NEO X Blockchain, making the logic visible to anyone, enhancing trust.
- **Traceable Transactions:** Upon successful transactions, users receive a transaction hash and a unique lock ID for tracking.
- **Data Transparency:** The lock ID stores all the necessary data about the transaction and can be viewed publicly under the "Read Lock" tab.

## How It Works

1.  **Deposit GAS:**
    - Users deposit GAS into the smart contract and specify the lock duration or vesting schedule under the "Locking" or "Payout" tab.
2.  **Transaction Hash & Receipt:**
    - Users receive a transaction hash to trace the transaction and a receipt containing a unique lock ID.
3.  **Read Lock Data:**
    - The lock ID can be used to view all transaction specifications under the "Read Lock" tab.

## Security and Transparency

GasLock leverages the NEO X Blockchain's robust infrastructure to ensure that funds are secure, and the contract logic is immutable and auditable. This level of transparency fosters trust among users and stakeholders.
